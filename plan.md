# Web App Plan: X Algorithm Simulator with Grok

This plan outlines the steps to build a web app that simulates Elon's X recommendation algorithm using xAI's Grok API. The app allows users to enter their X username, gathers context via X search, and displays personalized topic recommendations. We'll use Shadcn for modern UI components in light mode, with a React/Next.js frontend and Python backend.

## Project Overview
- **Frontend**: Next.js with Shadcn (light mode, no emojis)
- **Backend**: Python with xai-sdk-python
- **Models**: grok-4-fast for search/analysis, grok-code-fast-1 for algo logic
- **Features**: Username input, X data gathering, topic analysis, recommendation display

## Checklist and Steps

### 1. Project Setup
- [x] Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript
- [x] Install and configure Shadcn UI (light mode theme)
- [x] Set up Python backend environment (venv, dependencies)
- [x] Install xai-sdk-python and required libraries
- [x] Configure environment variables for xAI API keys

### 2. Backend Development
- [x] Create Python API endpoints for X search integration
- [x] Implement user context gathering using x_search tool
- [x] Develop analysis logic to extract topics/interests from search results
- [x] Build recommendation algorithm simulation using grok-code-fast-1 prompts
- [x] Add error handling and rate limiting for API calls

### 3. Frontend Development
- [x] Design main page layout with Shadcn components (input form, results display)
- [x] Implement username input component with validation
- [x] Create loading states and progress indicators
- [x] Build results display for topics and recommendations
- [x] Ensure responsive design and accessibility

### 4. Integration and Testing
- [x] Connect frontend to backend API endpoints
- [x] Test X search functionality with sample usernames
- [x] Validate topic extraction and recommendation accuracy
- [x] Implement unit tests for backend logic
- [x] Conduct end-to-end testing of the full flow

### 5. Deployment and Polish
- [x] Set up production build for Next.js
- [x] Deploy backend to a server (e.g., Vercel for frontend, Heroku for backend)
- [x] Add documentation and usage instructions
- [x] Optimize performance and security
- [x] Final review and bug fixes
