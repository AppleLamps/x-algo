Elon Musk has frequently discussed integrating Grok (xAI's AI model) into X's recommendation algorithm, emphasizing improvements in feed quality, fairness for small accounts, and user control. Here's a summary of his key statements on the topic, starting from the most recent:

### October 2025
On October 17, addressing complaints about link distribution, Musk clarified that X's AI algorithm—derived from Grok and developed by xAI—prioritizes posts based on their potential interest to users. He dismissed claims of intentional deboosting, noting that links with minimal description get weaker reach, while those with engaging text or images perform better.

On October 14, responding to praise for feed improvements, Musk attributed them to greater use of Grok and other AI tools, rather than manual tweaks. He announced an upcoming release of the updated algorithm (including model weights) that week, removing outdated rules. He also outlined plans for full AI recommendations by November, where Grok evaluates all 100M+ daily posts to surface personalized content, followed by dynamic adjustments like "show me less politics."

### September 2025
On September 19, Musk projected the algorithm becoming "purely AI" by November, with open-sourcing updates every two weeks. By November or December, users could tweak their feed via Grok queries.

### August 2025
On August 16, Musk shared early testing of a Grok 4 Mini-powered algorithm, calling it "definitely better" despite needing ~20k GPUs for full rollout and added latency.

### July 2025
On July 20, in response to concerns about small accounts' visibility, Musk highlighted using Grok to assess content's "intrinsic value" as a key focus for boosting high-quality posts from new or low-follower users.

### June 2025
On June 9, Musk explained that shifting to more Grok AI in recommendations would surface "banger posts" from small accounts in users' feeds. He also noted upcoming enhancements for reply sorting, potentially adding top replies to the main feed.

On June 3, amid feedback that X felt "boring" and manipulated, Musk teased a forthcoming Grok-powered algorithm that "will be great."

### May 2025
On May 3, Musk announced the recommendation algorithm's replacement with a lightweight Grok version, predicting "dramatic" improvements and noting some already visible.

### April 2025
On April 26, replying to a lament about political echo chambers on X, Musk promised a "much improved Grok-powered algorithm" to counterbalance extremes.

Overall, Musk's comments portray Grok as central to evolving X's algo toward AI-driven personalization, reduced spam, and better amplification of quality content— with rapid iterations planned through late 2025.
