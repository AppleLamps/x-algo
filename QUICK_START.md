## üîç What to Look For When Testing

### Backend Response
The `/analyze` endpoint now returns these new fields in `report`:

```javascript
{
  "diversity_metrics": {
    "diversity_score": 62,           // 0-100
    "topic_entropy": 0.68,           // 0-1
    "filter_bubble_risk": "Moderate", // Low|Moderate|High
    "viewpoint_diversity": "..."      // Text explanation
  },
  "opposing_viewpoints": {
    "included": true,                // Boolean
    "topics_with_diversity": ["..."], // Array of topics
    "explanation": "..."             // Text explanation
  },
  "temporal_analysis": {
    "recency_bias": "Moderate (balanced)", // High|Moderate|Low
    "temporal_mix_explanation": "...",     // Text
    "content_freshness": "65% recent, 35% evergreen" // Percentage
  },
  "recommendation_explanations": [
    {
      "signal_name": "SpaceX Content",
      "why_this_recommendation": "You engage significantly with...",
      "expected_impact": "SpaceX-related posts will appear..."
    },
    // ... 3-4 more items
  ]
}
```

## üìä Sample Output

When analyzing a profile like `@SpaceXFanAccount`:

```
üéØ DIVERSITY ASSESSMENT
Diversity Score: 58/100 [=========>----] 
Filter Bubble Risk: MODERATE ‚ö†Ô∏è
Topic Entropy: 68%

Viewpoint Diversity:
Your feed mixes technical content with policy perspectives. 
Good exposure to different angle on space policy.

üîÑ OPPOSING VIEWPOINTS
Topics with Diverse Perspectives:
[Space Policy] [Climate Impact] [Tech Innovation]

Strategy: For space-related content, posts addressing 
climate concerns and environmental impact are included 
to provide balanced perspective.

‚è±Ô∏è TEMPORAL MIX
Recency Bias: Moderate (balanced)
Content Freshness: 70% recent, 30% evergreen

Mix: Recent SpaceX launches and announcements will appear 
frequently, balanced with evergreen space exploration content 
and historical context.

üí° WHY THESE RECOMMENDATIONS?

SpaceX Content Amplification
Why: You engage significantly with SpaceX announcements 
and launch updates. This is clearly a primary interest.
Expected Impact: SpaceX posts will appear 40% more frequently.
You'll see more launch schedules, mission updates, and Starship news.

Tech Innovation Interest (+35%)
Why: Your replies and likes focus on innovative technology 
and engineering challenges, not just SpaceX specifically.
Expected Impact: Broader tech innovation content will appear 
in your feed alongside SpaceX-related posts.

Climate/Sustainability Balance (+15%)
Why: To ensure balanced perspective on space industry impact.
Expected Impact: You'll occasionally see posts discussing 
environmental and sustainability implications of space tech.
```

## üîß Configuration & Customization

### Diversity Score Thresholds
To change score ranges, modify in `frontend/src/app/page.tsx`:

```typescript
// Current defaults
diversity_score > 70 ? 'bg-green-500'   // Excellent
diversity_score > 50 ? 'bg-yellow-500'  // Moderate
// else: 'bg-red-500'                    // Poor
```

### Explanation Count
To change number of explanations shown, modify the prompt in `backend/services/xai_service.py`:

```python
# Current: 3-4 key signals
# Change to get more/fewer explanations
```

### Color Scheme
Each section uses different color:
- Indigo (Diversity)
- Emerald (Opposing Viewpoints)  
- Sky (Temporal)
- Fuchsia (Why Recommendations)

To change, modify Tailwind classes in `page.tsx`

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Frontend shows old sections only
- Clear browser cache: `Ctrl+Shift+Delete` (Chrome)
- Hard refresh: `Ctrl+F5` or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
- Check console for errors: `F12` ‚Üí Console tab

### Backend returns fewer fields
- Check XAI API key is valid
- Review LLM response in logs
- Try analyzing a different account
- Check token usage limits

### Missing explanations in response
- Verify prompt was updated correctly in `xai_service.py`
- Check if model is cutting off response due to length
- Try reducing context length in prompt

### ESLint warnings
- These are expected for dynamic width styling
- Can safely ignore or use ESLint disable comment
- Won't affect functionality
